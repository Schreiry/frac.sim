# Fractal Simulation


## Introduction

The **Fractal Simulation** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the mesmerizing world of fractalsâ€”mathematical constructs that reveal the beauty of complexity and self-similarity in nature. Through this project, I aim to create real-time visualizations of various fractals, showcasing their intricate patterns and stunning colors.

Fractals are not just mathematical curiosities; they are a bridge between mathematics and art, revealing the underlying structures of our universe. From the branching of trees to the formation of snowflakes, fractals are everywhere, and they offer a glimpse into the infinite complexity of nature.

## What Are Fractals?

Fractals are geometric shapes that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. This property is known as **self-similarity**. The most famous example of a fractal is the **Mandelbrot set**, which is defined by a simple mathematical formula but produces infinitely complex and beautiful patterns.

### Key Characteristics of Fractals

- **Self-Similarity**: Fractals exhibit the same pattern at different scales. Zooming into a fractal reveals more intricate details that resemble the overall shape.
- **Infinite Complexity**: Fractals can be infinitely detailed. No matter how much you zoom in, there are always more details to discover.
- **Non-Integer Dimensions**: Fractals often exist in non-integer dimensions, which means they can occupy space in ways that traditional geometric shapes cannot.

## Exploring Fractals

In this project, I am particularly interested in generating and visualizing two types of fractals: the **Mandelbrot set** and **Julia sets**. Each of these fractals has its own unique properties and visual characteristics.

### The Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is defined by the equation:

\[ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \]

where \( z \) and \( c \) are complex numbers. The beauty of the Mandelbrot set lies in its boundary, which is infinitely complex and exhibits self-similarity. As you zoom in on the boundary, you will find intricate patterns that repeat at different scales.

### Julia Sets

Julia sets are closely related to the Mandelbrot set and are defined by a similar iterative process. For a given complex number \( c \), the Julia set is generated by iterating the function:

\[ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \]

The shape of the Julia set varies dramatically depending on the value of \( c \). Some Julia sets are connected, while others are dust-like and fragmented.

## How Fractals Work

Fractals are generated through iterative processes, where a simple mathematical rule is applied repeatedly. The beauty of fractals arises from the interaction of simple rules and complex behavior. 

1. **Initialization**: Start with a point in the complex plane.
2. **Iteration**: Apply the fractal-generating formula repeatedly.
3. **Color Mapping**: Assign colors based on the number of iterations before a point escapes a defined boundary. This creates stunning visual effects.

### My Journey with Fractals

As I delve deeper into the world of fractals, I am continually amazed by their beauty and complexity. Each fractal I generate tells a story of mathematical elegance and artistic expression. Through this project, I hope to share my fascination with fractals and inspire others to explore the intersection of mathematics and art.

## Getting Started

To run the fractal simulation, follow these steps :

1. Clone the repository :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Schreiry/frac.sim.git

  or just download the files and run them. however you want. 
Note that in my small project, nothing serious has been done yet, 
even all the ideas have not been realized, 
although a shaky foundation has already been laid.

2. Navigate to the project directory :
   cd fractal-simulation

3. Install the required dependencies :
   pip install pygame
   
5. Run the simulation :
   python main.py
